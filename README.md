# Kaggle Titanic Survival Prediction

## A Jupyter Notebook exploring the Kaggle Machine Learning Competition

- Kaggle Titanic competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)
- Our Goal is to use machine learning to predict which passengers survived the titanic shipwreck.
- The data we are given includes a training set and a test set. The training set includes all available information about the passengers. The test set excludes survival information. 
- In addition to predicting survival outcome for titanic passengers, this notebook will review many of the steps that are necessary for achieving this. This includes DataFrame use, chart creation, and data prepration. 

The notebook exploring this problem can be found at notebooks/titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb
